# simpleneuralnetwork
A simple Neural Network library for non-complex tasks and to mess around
# Requirements
- Numpy (Essential)
- Pickle (Only if you want the load/save feature)
# Features
- You can add as many layers as you want to your NeuralNetwork and on that layer as many neurons as you want
  (I haven't tried any big numbers for the number of layers and the number of neurons yet because my computer can't handle it)
- Save and load weights from a file

Based from Siraj Raval's code (https://github.com/llSourcell/Make_a_neural_network) and Milo Harper's code (https://github.com/miloharper/multi-layer-neural-network).
I just added some extra features

Sorry for bad english
