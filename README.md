# simpleneuralnetwork
A simple Neural Network library for non-complex tasks and to mess around
# Requirements
- Numpy
- Pickle
# Features
- You can add as many layers as you want to your NeuralNetwork and on that layer as many neurons as you want
  (I haven't tried any big numbers for the number of layers and the number of neurons yet because my computer can't handle it)
- Save and load weights from a file
